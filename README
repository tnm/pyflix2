This is a (for now, just slightly) refactored version of `pyflix`, a
semi-official Python library for the Netflix API. The un-Pythonic syntax
and method names of pyflix were, tbh, driving me nuts,
so I changed those here; consequently this breaks compatibility with the
old existing library.

There are a few other minor changes.

This library here is under the GPL, because that's what the original
pyflix library is under.

I'll probably end up writing an entirely new client at some point.
